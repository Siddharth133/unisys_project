# Quantum Machine Learning for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Detection

## Abstract
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) represents a significant portion of cancer cases worldwide, with traditional detection methods often lacking in early and precise diagnosis. Leveraging Quantum Machine Learning (QML), we introduce a pioneering approach for detecting NHL using histopathological images. Our methodology integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for initial feature extraction, followed by a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) for enhanced detection capabilities. This novel approach aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, potentially leading to better treatment outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.

## Keywords
- Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
- Quantum Machine Learning
- Quantum Convolutional Neural Network
- Quantum Neural Network
- Histopathological Images

## Objectives
- Utilize CNN for initial feature extraction and QCNN for advanced feature representation.
- Implement QNN for accurate NHL detection, comparing its efficacy against traditional methods.

## Proposed Solution
Our solution follows a comprehensive workflow:
1. **Data Acquisition**: Compile a dataset comprising histopathological images and patient records.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Employ CNN for initial extraction, then enhance features with QCNN.
3. **Detection**: Leverage a QNN for final detection, aiming for higher accuracy and efficiency.
4. **Patient Privacy**: Ensure confidentiality through data de-identification techniques.

## Impact and Innovation
By applying QML to NHL detection, we aim to enhance diagnostic processes significantly. This research could serve as a catalyst for broader advancements in precision medicine and early disease detection, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing treatment costs.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the PCam dataset for training the QML model, available here:

## Current Progress
We have achieved an initial accuracy of 85.56% in NHL detection using our quantum-enhanced system, marking a promising step towards revolutionizing cancer diagnostics.
